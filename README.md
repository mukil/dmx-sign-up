# DMX Sign-up

This plugin introduces a configurable user registration process for DMX _User Accounts_. The plugin can be configured so users need to opt-in, utilizing confirmation emails (active for 60mins).

Most (if not all) user facing message are translatable by now. A german language version of this bundle can be build from source after setting the language option to `de` using the `plugin.properties` file.

This plugin adds:
*   A "User Mailbox" association type to associate "Email Address" w. "User Accounts".
*   A `Sign-up`-link next to the `Login`-button in the DMX Webclient
*   A `Sign-up Configuration` topic associated to the `DMX Sign up` Plugin topic
     (part of the "System" workspace and thus editable by all members of it)
*   A `Forgot password?` link to the `Login`-dialog in the DMX Webclient

The special features of the **self-registration ui** is comprised of:
*   Username existence check
*   Email existence check
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Minimal CSS Definition
*   Administration workspace members can create accounts without email confirmation

The special features of the **login ui** is comprised of:
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Automatic redirect
*   Minimal CSS Definition

The **special logic** of this plugin is comprised of:
*   Optionally: Setup an email based confirmation workflow for new accounts<br/>
    Sends confirmation mail with token to the users registering Email address<br/>
    Allows for the password reset functionality to take place also via an Email based confirmation workflow
*   Optionally: Send notifications to system administrator if a new user account was created
*   Optionally: If `dmx.security.new_accounts_are_enabled` (platform configuration option) is set to `true` an account activation notice is sent
*   Optionally: If a `User Mailbox` exists a "Passwort reset"-workflow is available
*   Optionally: A workspace URI can be specified whose members have the right to create new users.
*   Optionally: User accounts can be created through the LDAP plugin.

**Note:** If `Email Confirmation Required` is set to _true_ the confirmation tokens the system sends out are **not persisted** and get lost after a bundle/system restart. Once a token was send out the link containing it is valid for sixty minutes.

Email address topics of new user accounts are all placed in the "Administration" workspace too.

## Requirements

DMX 5.3: DMX is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
https://github.com/dmx-systems/dmx-platform

To be able to install this module you first and additionally have to install the following DMX Plugins.

*    `dmx-thymeleaf-0.9.3+`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-thymeleaf)
*    `dmx-sendmail-2.1.0+`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-sendmail)
*    `dmx-ldap-0.6.2-SNAPSHOT`+`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-ldap)

You can find the respective plugin version and its dependencies for download at [https://download.dmx.systems/plugins/](https://download.dmx.systems/plugins/).

**Operations:** For the plugins mailbox validation process to run you must install these plugins with DMX on a web server with a 
`postfix` -> `Internet Site` like mail send functionality.

After downloading all bundle-files, place them in the `bundle-deploy` folder of your DMX installation and restart DMX.

## Plugin Configuration

Since the 2.0.0 release, the following options must be configured in either the dmx-platform's `config.properties` (binary release) or `pom.xml` (if you run the platform from sources) file.

```
dmx.signup.confirm_email_address = true
dmx.signup.admin_mailbox = signup-test@dmx.systems
dmx.signup.system_mailbox = nomail@dmx.systems
dmx.signup.account_creation = admin
dmx.signup.account_creation_password_handling = generated
dmx.signup.account_creation_auth_ws_uri =
dmx.signup.ldap_account_creation = false
dmx.signup.token_expiration_time = 2
```

Legacy wise, the rest of the plugin options are stored in DB. The central topic for configuring the sign-up plugin is of type `Sign-up Configuration`. Editing this topic via the DMX Webclient allows you to interactively configure the appearance of the custom login and self-registration dialogs.

The sign-up configuration is associated with the "Plugin" topic representing this plugin ("DMX Sign up"). It can be revealed by all members of the `Administration` workspace.

Note: If you want to use the "Password reset" functionality without allowing users to self-register you must make sure "User Account" topics are equipped with a "User Mailbox". To set this up, see instructions here: https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-sign-up/-/issues/2

### Configure account creation logic

The sign-up can work in three different modes:

| Value    | Description                                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| disabled | nobody can create new accounts                                                              |
| admin    | only administrator (privileged users) can create new accounts                               |
| public   | anybody can create new accounts through self-registration in addition to the administrators |

The desired working mode is configured by setting the property: 
```
dmx.signup.account_creation = disabled | admin | public
```

The default value is "disabled" and also goes into effect when the value has been misspelled. 

If you only want to use the password-reset functionality and/or equip existing user accounts with an email address topic, please read the following hints: https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-sign-up/-/issues/2#note_17729

If you don't want to allow users to self-register accounts but want to make use of the sign-up plugin features, you find more [hints here](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-sign-up/-/issues/26#note_17855). Basically you need to log in as "admin" ("or Administration workspace member) first and then browse (manually) to `/sign-up` and use the form to create new accounts.

In order for an already logged in user have the permission to create a new user the former user either needs to be a member of the administration workspace or be a member of the workspace specified through the "dmx.signup.account_creation_auth_ws_uri" configuration option. Not setting this value means that only the
administration workspace membership check is in place.

### Configure account creation password handling

The plugin can be configured so that during sign-up one can enter the password to be used for the account or the
password is generated and users are required to do an initial password reset in order to set the password to a value
of their liking.

The behavior is configured through the option:

```
dmx.signup.account_creation_password_handling = editable | generated
```

### Token validity
The validity of the tokens used for account creation and password reset in *hours* is set through the property:
```
dmx.signup.token_expiration_time = 2
```

The default value is 2, so a user has two hours from the moment of creating the account/requesting the password reset to
click on the link that is contained in the account creation/password reset request email. 

### Optional module configuration

The module configuration is done through a configuration topic in DMX itself. However during the *first deployment* default values for the topic can be provided through the platform configuration through
the following properties:
```
dmx.signup.config_project_title =
dmx.signup.config_webapp_title =
dmx.signup.config_webapp_logo_path = 
dmx.signup.config_custom_css_path = 
dmx.signup.config_read_more_url = 
dmx.signup.config_pages_footer = 
dmx.signup.config_tos_label = 
dmx.signup.config_tos_detail = 
dmx.signup.config_pd_label = 
dmx.signup.config_pd_detail = 
dmx.signup.start_page_url = 
dmx.signup.home_page_url = 
dmx.signup.loading_app_hint = 
dmx.signup.logging_out_hint = 
dmx.signup.config_api_enabled = false 
dmx.signup.config_api_description =
dmx.signup.config_api_details =
dmx.signup.config_api_workspace_uri =
```

In case a value is not provided in the platform configuration a built-in default value is used.

### Setup Custom Workspace Assignment

There is currently just one more special configuration option: You can setup an automatic workspace assignment for self-registering users. If you do so, new users using the sign-up dialog automatically join (become members of) that works. To do so you need to associate that very workspace topic with your active sign-up configuration. 

And here comes the **pitfall**: To take this "custom workspace assignment" into effect you must press "Edit" and "Save" on your current sign-up configuration topic once (or restart the platform). Only in these two cases the sign-up configuration is reloaded and comes into effect, see [#1](https://github.com/mukil/dm4-sign-up/issues/1)).

You'll notice something similar to the following two lines in your server-side log (when editing and Saving your sign-up configuration):
```
Jan 15, 2021 01:28:37 AM systems.dmx.signup.SignupPlugin reloadAssociatedSignupConfiguration
INFORMATION: Configured Custom Sign-up Workspace => "DMX"
Jan 15, 2021 01:28:37 AM systems.dmx.signup.SignupPlugin reloadAssociatedSignupConfiguration
INFORMATION: Sign-up Configuration Loaded (URI="dmx.signup.default_configuration"), Name="My DMX"
```

### Account creation through LDAP plugin

The plugin can be configured to use the dmx-ldap plugin for account creation. When enabled the username and password are stored in LDAP instead of DMX itself. The option is disabled by default and is switched on by setting the property:

```
dmx.signup.ldap_account_creation = true
```

Keep in mind that the dmx-ldap plugin also has a configuration option that controls account creation functionality. This  must be enabled as well. Refer to the [plugins README](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-ldap/-/blob/master/README.md) for more information on its configuration. 

### Restricting authorization (login) methods and/or defining their order

The plugin allows restricting the allowed authorization methods by setting the property:
```
dmx.signup.dmx.signup.restrict_auth_methods = LDAP, BASIC
```

The value is a comma-separated list of auth method values. Please note that the order of the restriction list is
preserved in the web frontend. As such the property can also be used to enforce a certain auth method order.

When the property is not set, all known auth methods are allowed and their order is defined by the platform.
